# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

The LGBTQIA+ Literature Catalog is committed to providing a privacy-focused, accessible resource for discovering queer literature across different languages. We maintain this catalog as a static website to ensure fast access, offline capabilities, and resistance to censorship.

## Project Scope

This project:

- Maintains a curated catalog of LGBTQIA+ literature with their translations
- Operates without user accounts or user-generated content
- Prioritizes visitor privacy by minimizing tracking capabilities
- Provides offline access through downloadable archives
- Accepts content contributions only through:
  1. Direct pull requests to the GitHub repository
  2. Authorized editors via the content management system

For those contributing through pull requests or the CMS, we expect:

- Accurate and verifiable book information
- Respect for copyright and fair use
- Clear, factual descriptions without bias
