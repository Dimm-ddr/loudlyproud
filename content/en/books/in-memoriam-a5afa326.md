  bookTitle: In Memoriam
  book_description: A haunting, virtuosic debut novel about two young men who fall
    in love during a time of war.It's 1914, and World War I is ceaselessly churning
    through thousands of young men on both sides of the fight. The violence of the
    front feels far away to Henry Gaunt, Sidney Ellwood and the rest of their classmates,
    safely ensconced in their idyllic boarding school in the English countryside.
    News of the heroic deaths of their friends only makes the war more exciting.Gaunt,
    half German, is busy fighting his own private battle--an all-consuming infatuation
    with his best friend, the glamorous, charming Ellwood--without a clue that Ellwood
    is pining for him in return. When Gaunt's family asks him to enlist to forestall
    the anti-German sentiment they face, Gaunt does so immediately, relieved to escape
    his overwhelming feelings for Ellwood. To Gaunt's horror, Ellwood rushes to join
    him at the front, and the rest of their classmates soon follow. Now death surrounds
    them in all its grim reality, often inches away, and no one knows who will be
    next.An epic tale of both the devastating tragedies of war and the forbidden romance
    that blooms in its grip,In Memoriamis a breathtaking debut.
