    author Nina LaCour,following two women on a star-crossed journey toward each otherWhen
    Sara Foster runs away from home at sixteen, she leaves behind not only the losses
    that have shattered her world but the girl she once was, capable of trust and
    intimacy. Years later, in Los Angeles, she is a sought-after bartender, renowned
    as much for her brilliant cocktails as for the mystery that clings to her. Across
    the city, Emilie Dubois is in a holding pattern. In her seventh year and fifth
    major as an undergraduate, she yearns for the beauty and community her Creole
    grandparents cultivated but is unable to commit. On a whim, she takes a job arranging
    flowers at the glamorous restaurant Yerba Buena and embarks on an affair with
    the married owner.When Sara catches sight of Emilie one morning at Yerba Buena,
    their connection is immediate. But the damage both women carry, and the choices
    they have made, pulls them apart again and again. When Sara's old life catches
    up to her, upending everything she thought she wanted just as Emilie has finally
    gained her own sense of purpose, they must decide if their love is more powerful
    than their pasts.At once exquisite and expansive, astonishing in its humanity
    and heart,Yerba Buenais a love story for our time and a propulsive journey through
    the lives of two women finding their way in the world.
