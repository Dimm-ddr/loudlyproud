    after an unexpected pregnancy forces them to confront their deepest desires around
    gender, motherhood, and sex.reese almost had it all
  : 'a loving relationship with Amy, an apartment in New York City, a job she didn''t
    hate. She had scraped together what previous generations of trans women could
    only dream of: a life of mundane, bourgeois comforts. The only thing missing was
    a child. But then her girlfriend, Amy, detransitioned and became Ames, and everything
    fell apart. Now Reese is caught in a self-destructive pattern: avoiding her loneliness
    by sleeping with married men.Ames isn''t happy either. He thought detransitioning
    to live as a man would make life easier, but that decision cost him his relationship
    with Reese—and losing her meant losing his only family. Even though their romance
    is over, he longs to find a way back to her. When Ames''s boss and lover, Katrina,
    reveals that she''s pregnant with his baby—and that she''s not sure whether she
    wants to keep it—Ames wonders if this is the chance he''s been waiting for. Could
    the three of them form some kind of unconventional family—and raise the baby together?This
    provocative debut is about what happens at the emotional, messy, vulnerable corners
    of womanhood that platitudes and good intentions can''t reach. Torrey Peters brilliantly
    and fearlessly navigates the most dangerous taboos around gender, sex, and relationships,
    gifting us a thrillingly original, witty, and deeply moving novel.'
