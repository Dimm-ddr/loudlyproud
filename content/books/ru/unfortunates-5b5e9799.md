  bookTitle: Unfortunates
  book_description: 'An edgy, bitingly funny debut about a queer, half-Nigerian college
    sophomore who, enraged and exhausted by the racism at her elite college, sets
    out to find truth about The  Unfortunates—the unlucky subset of Black undergrads
    who have been mysteriously dying. Sahara is Not Okay. Entering her sophomore year
    at Elite University, she feels like a failure: her body is too curvy, her love
    life is nonexistent, her family is disappointed in her, her grades are terrible,
    and, well, the few Black classmates she has just keep dying. Sahara is close to
    giving up, herself: her depression is, as she says, her only “Life Partner.”And
    this narrative—taking the form of an irreverent, piercing “thesis” to the university
    committee that will judge her—is meant to be a final unfurling of her singular,
    unforgettable voice before her own inevitable disappearance and death. But over
    the course of this wild sophomore year, and supported by her eccentric community
    of BIPOC women, Sahara will eventually find hope, answers, and an unexpected redemption.'
