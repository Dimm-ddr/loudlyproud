  book_description: Her city is under siege. The zombies are coming back. And all
    Nona wants is a birthday party. In many ways, Nona is like other people. She lives
    with her family, has a job at her local school, and loves walks on the beach and
    meeting new dogs. But Nona's not like other people. Six months ago she woke up
    in a stranger's body, and she's afraid she might have to give it back. The whole
    city is falling to pieces. A monstrous blue sphere hangs on the horizon, ready
    to tear the planet apart. Blood of Eden forces have surrounded the last Cohort
    facility and wait for the Emperor Undying to come calling. Their leaders want
    Nona to be the weapon that will save them from the Nine Houses. Nona would prefer
    to live an ordinary life with the people she loves, with Pyrrha and Camilla and

    night, Nona dreams of a woman with a skull-painted face...
