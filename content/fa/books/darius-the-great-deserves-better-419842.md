    In this companion to the award-winning Darius the Great Is Not Okay, Darius
    suddenly has it all: a boyfriend, an internship, a spot on the soccer team.
    It’s everything he’s ever wanted–but what if he deserves better?


    Darius Kellner is having a bit of a year. Since his trip to Iran this past spring, a lot has changed. He’s getting along with his dad, and his best friend Sohrab is only a Skype call away. Between his first boyfriend, Landon, his varsity soccer practices, and his internship at his favorite tea shop, Darius is feeling pretty okay. Like he finally knows what it means to be Darius Kellner.


    Then, of course, everything changes. Darius’s grandmothers are in town for a long visit while his dad is gone on business, and Darius isn’t sure whether they even like him. The internship isn’t what Darius thought it would be, and now he doesn’t know about turning tea into his career. He was sure he liked Landon, but when he starts hanging out with Chip–soccer teammate and best friend of Trent Bolger, epic bully–well, he’s just not so sure about Landon anymore, either.


    Darius thought he knew exactly who he was and what he wanted, but maybe he was wrong. Maybe he deserves better.
