  book_description: A passionate tale of plague, fire, and forbidden love in seventeenth-century
    London from the acclaimed author of Solomon's Crown1666. It is a year after plague
    has devastated England. Young widow Cecilia Thorowgood is a prisoner, trapped
    and isolated within the cavernous London townhouse of her older sister. At the
    mercy of a legion of doctors who fail to cure her grief with their impatient scalpels,
    Cecilia shows no signs of improvement. Soon, her sister makes a decision borne
    of she hires a new physician, someone known for more unusual methods. But he is
    a foreigner. A Jew. And despite his attempts to save Cecilia, he knows he cannot
    quell the storm of grief that rages within her. There is no easy cure for melancholy.David
    Mendes fled Portugal to seek a new life in London, where he could practice his
    faith openly and leave the past behind. Still reeling from the loss of his beloved
    friend, struggling with his religion and his past, David finds himself in this
    foreign land, free and safe, but incapable of happiness—caring not even for himself,
    but only for his ailing father. The security he has found in London threatens
    to disappear when he meets Cecilia, and he finds himself torn between his duty
    to medicine and the beating of his own heart. He is the only one who can see her
    pain; the glimmers of light she emits, even in her gloom, are enough to make him
    believe once more in love.Facing seemingly insurmountable challenges, David and
    Cecilia must endure prejudice, heartbreak, and calamity before they can be together.
    A Great Fire is coming—and with the city in flames around them, love has never
    felt so impossible.
