  book_description: Sometimes the price of destiny is higher than anyone
    imagined.... Dark Magic, Hidden DestinyFor three centuries a divine prophecy
    and a line of warrior queens protected Skala. But the people grew complacent
    and Erius, a usurper king, claimed his young half sister’s throne. Now
    plague and drought stalk the land, war with Skala’s ancient rival Plenimar
    drains the country’s lifeblood, and to be born female into the royal line
    has become a death sentence as the king fights to ensure the succession of
    his only heir, a son. For King Erius the greatest threat comes from his own
    line — and from Illior’s faithful, who spread the Oracle’s words to a
    doubting populace. As noblewomen young and old perish mysteriously, the
    king’s nephew — his sister’s only child — grows toward manhood. But
    unbeknownst to the king or the boy, strange, haunted Tobin is the princess’s
    daughter, given male form by a dark magic to protect her until she can claim
    her rightful destiny. Only Tobin’s noble father, two wizards of Illior, and
    an outlawed forest witch know the truth. Only they can protect young Tobin
    from a king’s wrath, a mother’s madness, and the terrifying rage of her
    brother’s demon spirit, determined to avenge his brutal murder....
