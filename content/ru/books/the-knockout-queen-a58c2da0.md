  book_description: A dazzling and darkly comic novel of love, violence, and friendship
    in the California suburbsBunny Lampert is the princess of North Shore⁠--beautiful,
    tall, blond, with a rich real-estate-developer father and a swimming pool in her
    backyard. Michael⁠⁠--with a ponytail down his back and a septum piercing⁠--lives
    with his aunt in the cramped stucco cottage next door. When Bunny catches Michael
    smoking in her yard, he discovers that her life is not as perfect as it seems.
    At six foot three, Bunny towers over their classmates. Even as she dreams of standing
    out and competing in the Olympics, she is desperate to fit in, to seem normal,
    and to get a boyfriend, all while hiding her father's escalating alcoholism.Michael
    has secrets of his own. At home and at school Michael pretends to be straight,
    but at night he tries to understand himself by meeting men online for anonymous
    encounters that both thrill and scare him. When Michael falls in love for the
    first time, a vicious strain of gossip circulates and a terrible, brutal act becomes
    the defining feature of both his and Bunny's futures⁠⁠--and of their friendship.
    With storytelling as intoxicating as it is intelligent, Rufi Thorpe has created
    a tragic and unflinching portrait of identity, a fascinating examination of our
    struggles to exist in our bodies, and an excruciatingly beautiful story of two
    humans aching for connection.
