  bookTitle: Passing Strange
  book_description: 'San Francisco in 1940 is a haven for the unconventional. Tourists
    flock to the cities within the city: the Magic City of the World’s Fair on an
    island created of artifice and illusion; the forbidden city of Chinatown, a separate,
    alien world of exotic food and nightclubs that offer “authentic” experiences,
    straight from the pages of the pulps; and the twilight world of forbidden love,
    where outcasts from conventional society can meet.Six women find their lives as
    tangled with each other’s as they are with the city they call home. They discover
    love and danger on the borders where mystery, science, and art intersect.At the
    Publisher''s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management
    Software (DRM) applied.'
