  bookTitle: Nightcrawling
  book_description: 'Kiara and her brother, Marcus, are scraping by in an East Oakland
    apartment complex optimistically called the Regal-Hi. Both have dropped out of
    high school, their family fractured by death and prison. But while Marcus clings
    to his dream of rap stardom, Kiara hunts for work to pay their rent--which has
    more than doubled--and to keep the nine-year-old boy next door, abandoned by his
    mother, safe and fed.One night, what begins as a drunken misunderstanding with
    a stranger turns into the job Kiara never imagined wanting but now desperately
    needs: nightcrawling. Her world breaks open even further when her name surfaces
    in an investigation that exposes her as a key witness in a massive scandal within
    the Oakland Police Department.'
