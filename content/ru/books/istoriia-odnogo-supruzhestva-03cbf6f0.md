  book_description: We think we know the ones we love. So Pearlie Cook begins her indirect, and devastating exploration of the mystery at the heart of every relationship -- how we can ever truly know another person. It is 1953 and Pearlie, a dutiful young housewife, finds herself living in the Sunset District in San Francisco, caring not only for her husband's fragile health, but also for her son, who is afflicted with polio. Then, one Saturday morning, a stranger appears on her doorstep, and everything changes. Lyrical, and surprising, The Story of a Marriage is, in the words of Khaled Housseini, a book about love, and it is a marvel to watch Greer probe the mysteries of love to such devastating effect.
