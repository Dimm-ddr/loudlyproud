  book_description: We think we know the ones we love. So Pearlie Cook begins her
    indirect, and devastating exploration of the mystery at the heart of every
    relationship -- how we can ever truly know another person. It is 1953 and
    Pearlie, a dutiful young housewife, finds herself living in the Sunset
    District in San Francisco, caring not only for her husband's fragile health,
    but also for her son, who is afflicted with polio. Then, one Saturday
    morning, a stranger appears on her doorstep, and everything changes.
    Lyrical, and surprising, The Story of a Marriage is, in the words of Khaled
    Housseini, a book about love, and it is a marvel to watch Greer probe the
    mysteries of love to such devastating effect.

    - Andrew Sean Greer, Эндрю Шон Грир
