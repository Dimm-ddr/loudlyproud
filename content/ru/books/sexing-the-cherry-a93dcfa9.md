  bookTitle: Sexing The Cherry
  book_description: In a fantastic world that is and is not seventeenth-century England,
    a baby is found floating in the Thames. The child, Jordan, is rescued by Dog Woman
    and grows up to travel the world like Gulliver, though he finds that the world’s
    most curious oddities come from his own mind. Winterson leads the reader from
    discussions on the nature of time to Jordan’s fascination with journeys concealed
    within other journeys, all with a dizzying speed that shoots the reader from epiphany
    to shimmering epiphany.
